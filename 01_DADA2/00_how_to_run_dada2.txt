For my research, I performed sequence QC and taxonomic assignment with the BU16S pipeline 
developed by Dr. Michael Silverstein. See here for more information: 
https://github.com/Boston-University-Microbiome-Initiative/BU16s

I've created an example input script for you to copy, called 01_bu16s_example_inputs.sh. 

I recommend following this workflow for using BU16S:
1. Create a directory for each sequencing run you need to process. For example, I had six 
	sequencing runs, and for each run I needed to process both 16S and ITS sequences, so 
	I had a directories called Run1_16S, Run1_ITS, Run2_16S, Run2_ITS, etc. To create the
	directories, run the command "mkdir <directory name>" in the command line for each 
	directory you want to make. Make sure the directory name has no spaces. 
2. Copy my example input script (01_bu16s_example_inputs.sh) into each directory with the
	command "cp 01_bu16s_example_inputs.sh <directory name>/<file_name>". A good file name
	would include the sequencing run name and the amplicon sequence information, as well
	as "bu16s_inputs" (e.g. run1_16s_bu16s_inputs.sh).
3. Edit the input script for each sequencing run. Here are the edits you NEED to make:
	a. PROJECTNAME=<name_of_DADA2_run>
		I would name this something with your project ID and your sequencing run name
		(e.g. street_trees_run1_16s). Make sure there are no spaces in the name. 
	b. INPUTDIR=<path_to_input_directory>
		This is where your sequences are stored. If your sequences are not stored in the 
		directory where this script is, be sure to include the entire path, starting with 
		"/projectnb/".
	There might be other edits you should make to the script:
	a. OUTPUTDIR=$(pwd)
		Currently, this is set up so that the DADA2 outputs are stored in the directory 
		you just created and copied the input script into. If you want to store it 
		elsewhere, change this to the path to that directory. Be sure to include the 
		entire path, starting with "/projectnb/".
	b. INTERMEDIATEDIR=$(pwd)/intermediate
		Again, this is set up so that the intermediate directory is inside the directory
		you just created and copied the input script into. Change as above, including the 
		"/intermediate" part of the path in your path. 
	c. RUNPARAMETERS=$(pwd)/.runparams
		See b.
	d. FWD_FMT=_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz
		This is the format that Tufts uses. If you sequenced your amplicons with a 
		different facility, check what their forward read file naming format is and change
		it here. 
	e. REV_FMT=_L001_R2_001.fastq.gz
		Same as d. 
	f. FWD_PRIMER=
		When working with Tufts, they removed my primers from my sequences, so I left this
		field blank. If your sequencing facility does not remove your primers when they 
		process your sequences, add the primer sequence here. 
	g. REV_PRIMER=
		Same as g.
	h. SILVA_SEQUENCES=/projectnb/microbiome/ref_db/silva_132_99_16S.qza
		This is the default version of the SILVA database that the BU16S pipeline uses. If 
		you want to point to the UNITE v.9 (fungal) database instead, change this path to 
		/projectnb/microbiome/ref_db/UNITE/sh_refs_qiime_ver9_dynamic_25.07.2023.qza
		I downloaded a more recent version of the SILVA database (version 138.1)) and 
		saved it to the SCC (if you are in the Bhatnagar Lab, see my 
		Katies_data/Databases/ directory, and feel free to point to them here; otherwise, 
		download the SILVA database here: https://www.arb-silva.de/download/archive/ and 
		the UNITE database here: https://unite.ut.ee/repository.php)
	i. SILVA_TAXONOMY=/projectnb/microbiome/ref_db/silva_132_99_majority_taxonomy.qza
		Same as h. To point to the UNITE v.9 database instead, change this path to 
		/projectnb/microbiome/ref_db/UNITE/sh_taxonomy_qiime_ver9_dynamic_25.07.2023.qza
		If you need to download a more recent version of either database, the taxonomy 
		file will be zipped with the reference sequences file. 
	More advanced changes you might need to make:
	a. DADA2_ARGS=""
		If you are having issues with matching forward and reverse reads, you might need 
		to dig into the DADA2 documentation to tune the parameters. See more about that in
		Dr. Silverstein's documentation and the DADA2 documentation: 
		https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/
	b. PAIRED=True
		If you are having issues with matching forward and reverse reads, specifically 
		with reverse read quality, you might want to try running this pipeline on only the
		forward reads. If that is the case, change this parameter to "False" and change 
		the REV_FMT= parameter to "None" (don't include the quotes).
4. After adjusting your script, you are ready to run it! First, load the BU16S module with
	the command "module load bu16s". Then run the script with the following command:
	qsub -P <SCC project name> -N <Job name> $SCC_BU16S_DIR/bu16s.qsub <inputs_file_name>.sh
